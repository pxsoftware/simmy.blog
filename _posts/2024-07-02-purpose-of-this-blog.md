# What is the purpose of this blog?

I've never been a reader of blogs or newsletters or anything of the sort. The only reason I'm starting this blog is to organize my thoughts, reinforce topics that I'm learning by sharing with others, and archiving important information / shortcuts that I can come back to later. Often it's been the case that I've found a valuable solution to a technical problem, scrapped the project, then months down the road faced a similar (or the exact same) problem, and if only I had written down the solution I would'nt be pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot all over again.

I'm also trying to build back up my habit of reading. This is where I will share book reviews and lessons from different materials. Maybe not just books, but lectures, youtube videos, presentations, etc. I don't care who reads this blog, or if anybody reads this blog at all. I am posting for my future self and for my own research. If you happen to find this blog and the contents are useful for your own purposes, kudos.
